Project Directory

## Overview
This directory contains a collection of Python-based software projects showcasing basic to intermediate programming concepts. The projects include a command-line calculator, a password generator, and a GUI-based rock-paper-scissors game implemented with Tkinter.

## Project Descriptions

### 1. Calculator (CALCULATOR/)
A simple command-line calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations including:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)
- Includes error handling for division by zero and invalid operations

**Usage:** Run `python calculator.py` and follow the prompts to enter two numbers and an operation.

### 2. Password Generator (PASSWORD GENERATOR/)
A Python script that generates secure random passwords with the following features:
- Uses lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and symbols
- Enforces minimum password length of 8 characters for security
- Validates user input for password length
- Returns None if an invalid input is provided

**Usage:** Run `python password_generator.py` and enter the desired password length when prompted.

### 3. Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS GAME/)
A GUI-based implementation of the classic rock-paper-scissors game using Tkinter with the following features:
- Interactive visual interface
- Score tracking for player vs computer
- Reset functionality
- Attractive color scheme and button styling
- Responsive gameplay with visual feedback

**Usage:** Run `python rock_paper_scissors.py` to launch the game interface.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (for GUI in Rock-Paper-Scissors game)
- Built-in Python modules: random, string

## Development Conventions
- Simple, readable code structure suitable for learning
- Basic error handling for user input validation
- Modular approach with function definitions where applicable
- Clear variable names and basic comments

## Running the Projects
To run any of the projects, navigate to the project directory and execute:
```
python [script_name].py
```

For example, to run the calculator:
```
cd CALCULATOR
python calculator.py
```
